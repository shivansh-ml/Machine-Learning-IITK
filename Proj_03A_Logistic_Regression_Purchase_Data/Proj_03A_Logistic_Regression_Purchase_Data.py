#Logistic-Regression-Social-Network-Ads
#Using Logistic Regression model to predict if a person is 
#going to buy a new car or not based on the available data

#Problem
#A company is planning to launch a campaign for their new car brand 
#and would like to analyze which customers are most likely to 
#purchase the car so that the ads can specifically target them 
#To achieve this, they consult a social network advertising company 
#that possesses the data from another similar campaign. 
#It is now desired to construct a model to achieve the above goal.

#Dataset
#The dataset contains 400 entries for each of the features 
#userId
#gender
#age
#estimatedsalary 

#The target is 
#purchased history 
#The features taken into account are age and estimated salary which are 
#required to predict if the user will purchase a new car (1=Yes, 0=No)
